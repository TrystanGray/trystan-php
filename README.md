Making my personal website project.


## Milestone 1 Feedback

Great work here - your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are thoughtful, detailed, and well defined. I'm looking forward to seeing your content strategy and UI design concepts to come in Milestone 2a.

Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks great - nice work.

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier IV. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2a.


## Milestone 2a Feedback

For the "See project here" links, I am concerned that you are biting off more than you can chew.  This should be a single page, not multiple. If these are links to an external site, then you can leave them in, but if you have them conceived as links to other pages on this site, dial your ambition back a bit.  Make that a "nice to have" if you have extra development time, not something that's required at this point.

### Minor nitpicks
* You have a few grammatical errors sprinkled throughout.  Your capitalization is inconsistent, you have spaces after quotes here and there, a few typos, etc.
* I don't understand what you're going for in this sentence: "MAKE IT KNOWN YOU ARE JUST STARTING."  Make the user know they are just starting and that there's more on the page?

Overall, nice work.  You've got a really clear outline here, well done.  You hit all the major points.  This passes as Tier IV.  You are now clear to start Milestone 2b.  You can read it over on the website for now, it'll be formally assigned later this week. - PRS
