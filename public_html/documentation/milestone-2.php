		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
		<p>
			<strong> Overall Goal:</strong>
			My goal is to have a visually appealing site using varying colors and combining it with being dynamic.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong> Welcome: </strong>
			When the user first opens my web page i want it to feel almost soft and peaceful,
			i will have soft colors ex: beige, cream white, soft browns paired with a beautiful
			nature picture as the header area, below this or overlayed would be a basic intro for myself.
			It would say "Trystan Gray; Web Developer, Designer, and explorer" or something like that.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong> About Me: </strong>
			(should this be swapped position wise with projects?)
			This would be the first thing they see when they scroll down, the soft colors fade into more energetic
			colors like electric blue, candy red, ice white, etc.. This section would tell a little of my skills,
			backstory, hobbies as well as future goals. This is the WHY part of people buying my product.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong> Projects: </strong>
			I want the icons to flow up with the page
			and "settle" in to their spots (this would look like the project squares have some movement to them.)
			thye could then click on the projects for a full report on it including the actual site and code or they
			could hover over for a brief overview. MAKE IT KNOWN YOU ARE JUST STARTING
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong> Contact me: </strong>
			in this section i will have a short statement saying something like " Contact me for any questions,
			quotes on projects, or to schedule your project." then below is a contact form with:
			Name, Number, email, and memo about why they're contacting me. There will also be links to
			email me more directly than the contact form, links to my linked in and github as well.
		</p>
